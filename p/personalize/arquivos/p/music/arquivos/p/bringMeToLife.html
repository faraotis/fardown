                How can you see into my eyes <br>
                Like open doors? <br>
                Leading you down into my core <br>
                Where I've become so numb

                All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see <br>
                Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me <br>
                I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems <br>
                Got to open my eyes to everything <br>
                Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul <br>
                Don't let me die here <br>
