                The birds have left their trees <br>
                The light pours onto me <br>
                I can feel you lying there all on your own <br>
                We got here the hard way <br>
                All those words that we exchange <br>
                Is it any wonder things get broke?

                'Cause in my heart and in my head <br>
                I'll never take back the things I said <br>
                So high above, I feel it coming down <br>
                She said, "In my heart and in my head <br>
                Tell me why this has to end <br>

                I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall <br>
                We built this town on shaky ground <br>
                I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no <br>
                We built it up to pull it down

                Now all the birds have fled <br>
                The hurt just leaves me scared <br>
                Losing everything I've ever known <br>
                It's all become too much <br>
                Maybe I'm not built for love <br>
                If I knew that I could reach you, I would go
