                This ain't a song for the broken-hearted<br>
                No silent prayer for faith-departed <br>
                And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd<br>
                You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

                But I ain't gonna live forever<br>
                I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
                (It's my life)<br>
                My heart is like an open highway<br>

                Yeah, this is for the ones who stood their ground<br>
                For Tommy and Gina, who never backed down <br>
                Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake<br>
                Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks
