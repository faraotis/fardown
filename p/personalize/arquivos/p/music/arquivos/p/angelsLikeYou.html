                Flowers in hand, waiting for me<br>
                Every word in poetry<br>
                Won't call me by name, only "baby"<br>
                The more that you give, the less that I need
                <br>
                <br>
                Everyone says I look happy <br>
                When it feels right

                I know that you're wrong for me<br>
                Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave<br>
                I brought you down to your knees<br>
                'Cause they say that misery loves company<br>
                It's not your fault I ruin everything<br>
                And it's not your fault I can't be what you need<br>
                Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me
            </p>

                I'm everything they said I would be <br>
                La-la-la <br>
                I'm everything they said I would be <br>
                <br>
                I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye <br>
                Before you let go, just one more time <br>
                Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine <br>
                A little more hurt won't kill you <br>
                <br>
                Tonight, mother says, "You don't look happy" <br>
                Close your eyes
